h1. Git Hooks

bq. This branch contains my common pool of Git hooks for, most notably, pre-commit and post-merge.

To use these simply check out a copy of this repository somewhere and switch to the @hooks@ branch, then symlink the hooks you want into your own repository's @.git/hooks@ folder.  (Create the folder if it doesn't exist.)

h2. pre-commit-django

This hook is geared towards a Django project as it calls @manage.py validate@ as the first check.  Removing this check makes the hook suitable for any Python project, though classifying use of @print@ (except in very specific areas of your application) may be too restrictive for some projects.

Here's an example of the output:
